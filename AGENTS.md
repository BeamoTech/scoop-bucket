# Scoop bucket — agent guide

`AGENTS.md` is the sole guide for all agents.

Windows package manifests for Beamo tools. Read [README.md](README.md) and the
relevant JSON manifest before editing. Application source lives in separate repos.

## CI, cost and documentation

Read `~/dev/AGENTS.md` for shared checkout, cost, documentation and storage rules.

- Iterate locally; run the applicable full local gate before release. Hosted
  CI is only for necessary final public/customer production verification,
  never routine work, draft PRs, previews or unshipped instruction/doc maintenance. Local
  scripts named `ci` remain local; do not push merely to trigger CI.
- Run the fewest required hosted jobs. Reuse only evidence for the exact final
  SHA, artifacts and config; revalidate after changes. Fix every candidate/gate
  failure and material warning, then rerun until all applicable checks pass.
  Pending, canceled, blocked, timed out and unexpected skips are not passes;
  path skips require workflow evidence. Never weaken tests/coverage or retry blindly.
- Check automatic triggers and gate publication on successful verification.
  Preserve required statuses, branch protection, scheduled security/ops checks,
  native acceptance and approvals; record proof and verify after deployment.
  No hosted CI means retain local/manual gates. Changes to automation or
  publication need task authority. Avoid duplicate providers/runs.

**Project gate:** Parse manifests locally during development. Before public install/update
changes, verify upstream bytes and final native Windows behavior; use the
manual `verify-claudex.yml` only when the Claudex release needs that gate,
including upgrade coverage when applicable. Guide edits do not need hosted
Windows jobs or installation into the user's environment.

## Package integrity

Keep versions, architecture mappings, dependencies, release URLs and SHA-256
digests aligned with verified upstream release bytes. Never guess a checksum.
Parse changed JSON and validate install/update behavior on Windows for package
changes; parsing alone does not prove a native installation.
Do not install tools into the user's environment merely to review documentation.
Publishing manifests affects installs; preserve approval and release boundaries.
Preserve unrelated work and stage only explicit owned paths.
